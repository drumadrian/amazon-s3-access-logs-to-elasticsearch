# sam-app

This is a sam-app - Below is a brief explanation:


## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with at least PowerUser permission
* [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Python Virtual Environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)

## Setup process
```bash
sam validate
sam build
sam deploy
```

### Building the project

[AWS Lambda requires a flat folder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html) with the application as well as its dependencies. When you make changes to your source code or dependency manifest,
run the following command to build your project local testing and deployment:
 
```bash
sam build
```
By default, this command writes built artifacts to `.aws-sam/build` folder.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --stack-name sam-app \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name sam-app \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```
